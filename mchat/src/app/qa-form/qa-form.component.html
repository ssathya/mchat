  <strong>Total Score is 0-2:</strong> A score between 0 and 2 indicates LOW risk. There's no need to take any further action at
  the moment. If your child is younger than 24 months though, then recommend that you screen again after the second birthday.

<div *ngIf="score >=3 && score <=7" class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Total Score is 3-7:</strong> A score between 3 and 7 indicates MEDIUM risk. We recommend that you contact your child's
  pediatrician for diagnostic evaluation and eligibility evaluation for early intervention. ABA therapy and other interventions
  have been shown to be incredibly effective when used early and can dramatically improve your child’s quality of life.

<div *ngIf="score >=8 && score <=20" class="alert alert-danger">
  <strong>Total Score is 8-20:</strong> A score between 8 and 20 indicates HIGH risk. We recommend you to immediately contact your

  of life.
